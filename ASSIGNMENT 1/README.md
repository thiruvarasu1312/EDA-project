# EXPT NO: 1 – Implementation of Data Charts using R

## 📅 Date
06-01-2026

## 📌 Objective
To design and implement appropriate data charts to analyze and compare academic performance indicators of students using R programming.

## 🏫 Scenario
An autonomous engineering college analyzes internal assessment performance of first-year students across multiple subjects to identify difficult courses and improve teaching strategies.

## 📂 Dataset
**File name:** `1.student_performance.csv`

**Attributes:**
- Student_ID
- Department
- Semester
- Subject
- Internal_Test1
- Internal_Test2
- Assignment_Marks
- Attendance_Percentage
- Final_Grade

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- R Programming Language
- ggplot2
- dplyr

## 🧪 In-Lab Tasks Performed
1. Loaded required R libraries (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`)
2. Imported dataset using `read.csv()`
3. Performed basic data preprocessing
4. Created bar chart for subject-wise average marks
5. Generated line chart for performance trend across internal tests
6. Plotted pie chart for grade distribution

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Bar Chart:** Subject-wise average marks  
- **Line Chart:** Performance trend across Internal Test 1 and Test 2  
- **Pie Chart:** Final grade distribution  

## 📈 Outcome
The visualizations help identify low-performing subjects, analyze performance trends, and understand grade distribution, supporting data-driven academic decisions.

## 📎 How to Run
1. Open RStudio
2. Place the dataset inside `R_Lab` folder
3. Run the R script containing the visualization code
4. View the generated charts

## ✅ Conclusion
Data visualization using R provides meaningful insights into student performance and supports evidence-based improvements 👍
